Tower of Hanoi

This is a Python implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem using the Pygame library. The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from the first rod to the last rod, obeying the following rules:

    Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
    No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Prerequisites

    Python 3
    Pygame library

Installation

    Clone or download the repository.
    Install the Pygame library by running the following command:

    pip install pygame

    Create a directory named "hanoi" in the following path C:\Users\User\Desktop\hanoi.
    Place the "images.png", "back.png", and "hanoi.py" files inside the "hanoi" directory.

How to Play

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the "hanoi" directory.
    Run the script using the following command:

    python hanoi.py

    Upon running the script, a window titled "Tower of Hanoi" will appear.
    Enter the number of disks you want to use in the game. The number of disks should be a positive integer.
    Press Enter to start the game.
    The game window will display three towers. The first tower will initially have all the disks stacked in decreasing order of size.
    The objective is to move all the disks to the last tower while following the rules mentioned above.
    The program will automatically solve the Tower of Hanoi problem and visualize the moves step by step.
    Once the game is completed, you can close the window to exit the program.

Enjoy playing the Tower of Hanoi!
